Feature Transformation using Machine Learning techniques - PCA & LDA

## Feature Transformation using PCA for Dimensionality Reduction on Wine Dataset

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a powerful statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction. It transforms a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional form while preserving as much variability as possible. This is particularly useful when dealing with datasets containing multiple variables, as it can simplify the data without losing significant information.

### Objective
To use PCA to transform the wine dataset, capturing most variations in the measurements with a small number of principal components, thus making it easier to distinguish between red and white wine.

### Conclusion
By applying PCA, we have transformed the high-dimensional wine dataset into a lower-dimensional form. The first two principal components capture the majority of the variance in the dataset, making it easier to visualize and distinguish between different classes of wine. This dimensionality reduction simplifies the analysis and can help in various tasks such as classification, clustering, and visualization.

## Feature Transformation using LDA for Classification on Iris Dataset

**Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique that is used for classification. It projects the data in a way that maximizes the separation between multiple classes.

### Objective
To apply LDA on the Iris dataset and classify which species a given flower belongs to.

### Conclusion
By applying LDA, we have reduced the dimensionality of the Iris dataset while maximizing the separation between different species. This allows for more effective classification of the species, achieving high accuracy. LDA is particularly useful in supervised learning tasks where the goal is to enhance class separability.
